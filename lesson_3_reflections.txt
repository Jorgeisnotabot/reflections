When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I guess when you aren't working on your computer and you may have thought of a new feature or another person is working in a new feature for the project
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes you are not the only person working on the project and maybe you are working in a new feature and if someones has made a change that can have impact on your project you don't want that automatically mess up with your version on your computer
