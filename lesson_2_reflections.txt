What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Because without creating an instance of git in the folder it won't be a repository, it would be just a folder without the .git file
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It offers an intermediate step to actually know what logical change we are about to make a commit of it
